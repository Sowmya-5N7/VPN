# Working with VPNs
## Objective
Understand how VPNs protect privacy and secure communication. 
## Tools used
-  ProtonVPN (Free Tier)
-  DNS Leak Test

## Steps Performed
-   Installed ProtonVPN (Free Tier).
-   Connected to a server in the Romania.
-   Verified IP change using `whatismyipaddress.com`.
-   Checked for DNS leaks.

## Results
-  Successfully masked IP (Original: `157.50.134.233` â†’ New: `146.70.246.170`).
-  No DNS leaks detected.
-  Browsing speed decreased by ~20% (expected due to encryption).

## Conclusion  
VPNs are effective for privacy but may reduce speed. Free tiers have limited servers.
